<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get started on contributing to the project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

* Rust (install using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

### Building

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse125-sp23/group-5.git
    ```
2. Build the project
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```
3. Run the server and client(s)
    1) In debug mode(running locally)
    ```sh
    cargo run --features debug --bin server # start the server
    cargo run --features debug --bin client # start a client
    ```
    2) In production mode
   ```sh
    cargo run --features prod --bin server # start the server
    cargo run --features prod --bin client # start a client
    ```

<!-- Testing -->

## Testing

All the unit tests are attached in the src directories in each file with the code that theyâ€™re testing.
The convention is to create a module named tests in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module
with `cfg(test)`.

1. Run all unit tests
    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```
2. Run tests specific to a crate
    ```sh
    cargo test -p [client|server|common]
    ```
3. Run tests specific to a module
    ```sh
    cargo test -p [client|server|common] -- [module_name]
    ```

<!-- Documentation -->

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using `cargo doc`. The documentation is generated in the `target/doc` directory.

1. Generate documentation and open it in a browser
    ```sh
    cargo doc --open
    ```

<!-- PROJECT STRUCTURE -->

## Project Structure

This project follows a monorepo architecture, where the client, server, and common libraries reside in a single
repository.
There are 3 crates in this project: `client`, `server`, and `common`.

- `client`: This folder contains the code and resources for the game client. The client is responsible for rendering the
  game, handling user input, and communicating with the server.
- `server`: This folder contains the code and resources for the game server. The server is responsible for managing game
  state, handling client connections, and processing game events.
- `common`: This folder houses the shared Rust library that contains code and resources used by both the client and
  server. This can include shared data structures and and utility functions.
